Description
------------

Here you can find the output related to the simulation study in Section 5.3.

###Output

	NVLearning-Simulation.txt				==> The aggregated simulation result of the models (aggregated total profit over 100 periods)
	byPeriod/*.txt							==> Profit of each period
###Figure

	Figure-Simulation-Profit-1.pdf			==> Figure 6a
	Figure-Simulation-Profit-15.pdf			==> Figure 6b	Figure-Simulation-Profit-aggregate.pdf	==> Plot of aggregate comparison (not in the paper)

###Scripts

	Script-SimulationProfitPlot.R			==> R script for plotting Figure-Simulation-Profit-aggregate.pdf	Script-SimulationByPeriodPlot.R			==> R script for plotting Figure 6a and 6b

Instructions
------------

The R scripts require a working R environment (http://www.r-project.org/). The scripts are only tested on R version 2.15, but should be running smoothly on newer versions. The scripts do not require extra R packages.
