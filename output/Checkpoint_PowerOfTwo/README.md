Description
------------

Here you can find the output related to the Checkpoint models (IC[M] and SC[M]) with M = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.

	NVLearning_CheckpointA_myopic.PowerOfTwo.txt	==> The output of the IC[M] model for M = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 with myopic inventory decision	NVLearning_CheckpointB.PowerOfTwo.txt			==> The output of the SC[M] model for M = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32	NVLearning_CheckpointB_myopic.PowerOfTwo.txt	==> The output of the SC[M] model for M = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 with myopic inventory decision
###Figure

	Figure-Checkpoint-PowerOfTwo.pdf				==> Figure 5a

###Scripts

	Script-Checkpoint-PowerOfTwo.R					==> R Script for plotting Figure 5a

Instructions
------------

The R scripts require a working R environment (http://www.r-project.org/). The scripts are only tested on R version 2.15, but should be running smoothly on newer versions. The scripts do not require extra R packages.
