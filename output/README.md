Description
------------

Here you can find the output (.txt files) of the code in the src/ folder, the R script (.R files) for generating publishable figures, and the figures (.pdf files).


Instructions
------------

The R scripts require a working R environment (http://www.r-project.org/). The scripts are only tested on R version 2.15, but should be running smoothly on newer versions. The scripts do not require extra R packages.
