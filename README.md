>Description:

>* Folder _NVLearning/src_ hosts the C++ code for the models developed in the paper. The codes essentially solve the dynamic programs developed in the paper to obtain the optimal inventory control policies and expected profits.

>* Folder _NVLearning/output_ hosts the raw output data files generated by the C++ codes, the R scripts for cleaning, organizing, summarizing, and plotting these data, and the final output (in the format of Tables and Figures) published in the paper.
