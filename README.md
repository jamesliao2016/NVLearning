>Description:

>* Folder _NVLearning/src_ hosts the C++ code for the models developed in the paper: additive MMFE, multiplicative MMFE, additive MMFE with fixed ordering costs, and additive MMFE with order cancelations. The codes essentially solve the dynamic programs developed in the paper to obtain the optimal inventory control policies and expected profits.

>* Folder _NVLearning/output_ hosts the raw output data files generated by the C++ codes, the R scripts for cleaning, organizing, summarizing, and plotting these data, and the final output (in the format of Tables and Figures) published in the paper.

Instructions
------------

The C++ codes are re-written using the new C++11 standard library and the Boost C++ Library (http://www.boost.org/). In order to compile them, you will need:
        
1. An update-to-date C++ compiler (GNU GCC 4.7 or Intel C++ Compiler 13.0) supporting C++11 and OpenMP
2. Install the Boost Library (v1.53.0 or newer, check it out at http://www.boost.org/).
3. To compile (assuming the install directory of the Boost Library is "/usr/local/boost_1_53_0")

        by ICC: "icpc -openmp -std=c++11 -O3 -lboost_serialization -lboost_program_options -I /usr/local/boost_1_53_0 -L /usr/local/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib -o NVLearning_Timing.exe  NVLearning_Timing.cpp"
        
        by GCC: â€œg++ -fopenmp -std=c++11 -O3 -lboost_serialization -lboost_program_options -I /usr/local/boost_1_53_0 -L /usr/local/boost_1_53_0/stage/lib -o NVLearning_Timing.exe  NVLearning_Timing.cpp"


The R scripts require a working R environment (http://www.r-project.org/). The scripts are only tested on R version 2.15, but should be running smoothly on newer versions. The scripts do not require extra R packages.
